## What is this?
This is a modified .dotfiles repo to share with some people that asked about using Windows and Molten on Reddit. I also included the following image that shows my rplugin.vim file. However, this file does not belong in /nvim/ on Windows. Instead it needs to be placed into /nvim-data/ and the path would need to be updated to reflect your own personal path.


### My rplugin manifest that I have to modify for Molten and recreate when Molten is initially installed/updated.
